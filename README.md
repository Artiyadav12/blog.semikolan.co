## Database seeding

**Populate the database with seed data with relationships which includes users, blogs, categories, subcategories, reports and subscribers. This can help you to quickly start testing  and start using it with ready content.**

Open the DatabaseSeeder and set the property values as per your requirement

Run the database seeder and you're done
